This repository contains two main projects: **Selfie Records SDK** and **Selfie Records Website**. Each project extends the use of DNS TXT records, from SDK-based interactions to visual presentation and documentation on the website.

## Projects

### 1. [Selfie Records SDK](./1_package/README.md)

The **Selfie Records SDK** is designed to interact with DNS TXT records, offering a robust solution for storing and retrieving data, extending the concept of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 353 to support a broad range of data types using standard DNS infrastructure.

#### 📚 Key Features:
- Support for various data types via DNS TXT records.
- A robust SDK that simplifies developers' interaction with DNS TXT records.
- Enhanced security with **DNSSEC** to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

#### 🚀 Installation:
```bash
npm i selfie-records
```

#### ⚙️ Usage:
```javascript
import { getRecords } from "selfie-records";

async function fetchRecords() {
  const records = await getRecords({
    name: "hello@miguelmedeiros.dev",
    filters: ["bitcoin-payment", "nostr-key"], // optional
    dnsServer: "1.1.1.1", // optional
  });

  console.log(records);
}

fetchRecords();
```

For more details, check the [SDK README](./1_package/README.md).

### 2. [Selfie Records Website](./2_app/README.md)

The **Selfie Records Website** is the official website built using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**. It showcases the interface for interacting with DNS TXT records, highlighting the use of payments, identities, and other data through this technology.

#### 💻 Tech Stack:
- **Next.js**
- **TailwindCSS**

#### 🛠️ Setup and Development:
To run the development server:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

For more information, see the [Website README](./2_app/README.md).
